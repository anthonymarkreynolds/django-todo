# Django Todo App

## Overview

This is a simple web application built using the Django framework. I am building this app to get my feet wet with Django and learn the ropes.

The app allows users to create todo items, mark them as complete, and delete them. Users can also view a list of all their todo items.

Throughout the development of this app, I have learned how to set up a Django project, create and manage a database, create models and views, and handle user authentication. I have also learned how to use third-party packages to simplify certain tasks, such as handling environment variables and managing static files.

This app is still a work in progress, and I plan to continue adding new features and improving its functionality.
